# getxfavitems

In this short tasks series:

TASK 1: Create a list, then like items within the list, the liked items should be showed on a separate screen. Do it through getx.

SOLUTION:

I have created a controller for getx properties. In the controller, I have initialized two lists, one is properly defined and the other is just initialized in which the liked items will be added dynamically. 

Two functions are also defined, one for adding favourite items two the dynamic list while the other to delete items from the dynamic list.

The home screen display the static list and the other screen display list of favourite/liked items.
